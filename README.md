# Cryptocurrency Price Prediction Model
This is a machine learning model which basically functions to accurately forceast future price of the Cryptocurrency **"Ethereum" in USD**  
Since the data used in this project will be timeseries data so I will be using Long Short Term Memory(LSTM) model throught this project.
## Crypto Model 1:
This is the very first code that I had written for this project, where I discovered the Open, High, Low, Close or also known as **OHLC** dataset of the cryptocurrency "Etherum". And I also explored two libraries for plotting the financial data, from which the first one is [Mplfinance](https://coderzcolumn.com/tutorials/data-science/candlestick-chart-in-python-mplfinance-plotly-bokeh#) which offers multiple types and styles of graph to plot financial data, from which my favourite type is 'candle' and style is 'tradingview' but it lacks customisation of the graph which makes it a very limited library for plotting the graphs. And the second library that I explored is [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/3.5.3/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.html) which is a very big library and offers a quite large range of customization for the graphs which makes it very useful for my project. Nevertheless, I will be using both of these libraries throughout the code of this project.
